    "Understanding of COVID-19 data educates the people, organizations and the governments of the countries about the development  and progression of the disease in the world and in their country. It is very important to be aware about how steadily and severely the virus is advancing, to cope with it by updating the stringency of the regulatory laws on businesses, people’s movements and travel. \n",

    "This project aims to understand the COVID-19 severity worldwide by analyzing the country wise data for COVID-19 in terms of cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases and testing count.

    "   Since our interest is in analyzing the data country wise and not to focus on different provinces of the data, hence we group the data by “Country/Region” and also remove the “Lat” and “Long” columns as we don’t intend to use them in our project.

    "We follow the same steps for “Deaths” and “Recovered Cases” data, only the difference that when we change the dates to days as in part D above (of Data Cleaning), we keep the day 1 as a day on which the number of “Confirmed Cases” for the country reached 10 or more. Which means we do not define the day 1 in “Deaths” data as the day on which deaths for the country reached 10 or more or in case of “Recovered cases” day 1 is not defined by day on which number of recovered cases reached 10 or more but we keep the day 1 as the day on which “Confirmed Cases”  for the country reached 10 or more again. This way we will have day 1 as a unique element for every country irrespective of whether we are dealing with “Confirmed Cases” , “Deaths” or “Recovered Cases” and even for “Testing Counts” we are going to discuss in the following part.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Removing the not required columns in the Testing data. We only keep the following three columns and remove everything else from the data. <br> <br>\n",

    "4. Changing the \"Date\" column from object type to type datetime and then changing it to the format present in Confirmed Cases/ Deaths/Recovered Cases datasets for \"Dates\"\n",

    "5. Pivoting the Testing data such that the individual dates form the separate columns\n",

    "\n",
    "   Every country has \"Testing\" data available from different dates but on pivoting dates start from 01/01/20 or all countries because one of the countries \"Mexico\" has the \"Testing\" data available from this date (the earliest date amongst all countries). So as a result on pivoting, the date columns start from this date. And we will have null values for every other country from 01/01/20 till the date on which the country had testing data reported for the first time. For example for \"Argentina\" the testing data is available from 04/08/20, so we see \"NaN\" values from 01/01/20 to 04/07/20. Same is true for other countries. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Filling Missing values with appropriate values\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two kinds of null values in “Testing” data <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The null values before the 1st non-empty value for testing of the country. For example        for Australia the “Testing” data is available from 03/22/20 but since the date columns        start from 01/01/20 so there will be NaN values present from 01/01/20 to 03/21/20 for        Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div style=\"text-align: left\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namitachhibba/Figures-and-gifs/master/vid4.gif\" width=\"500\" /></div> <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Besides that even after the “Testing” data gets started to be collected by the country        on a specific date but still after that date there are null values which refer to the        dates for which the testing data was not updated.For example for Australia first              \"Testing\" data observation is present on 03/22/2020 but after that there are missing          values from 03/23/20 to 03/28/20 and further from 03/30/20 to 04/04/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div style=\"text-align: left\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namitachhibba/Figures-and-gifs/master/vid5.gif\" width=\"500\" /></div> <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    How to deal with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - First we replace the in between missing values with the previous non-null value. For          example for Australia we will fill the null values from 03/23/20 to 03/28/20 with            value at 03/22/20 and the null values from 03/30/20 to 04/04/20 with value at 03/29/20       <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "     <div style=\"text-align: left\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namitachhibba/Figures-and-gifs/master/vid6.gif\" width=\"500\" /></div> <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "     - After this we will have null values only before the first non-null testing value for          the country. For example for Australia the null values for “Testing” data are now only        present from 01/01/20 to 03/21/20 and so since no testing was done during this time          period for Australia so we can safely replace these null values with zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "     <div style=\"text-align: left\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namitachhibba/Figures-and-gifs/master/vid7.gif\" width=\"500\" /></div> <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "      Hence, now we have no null values in our testing data! Awesome!<br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Preparing the testing data to be merged with the \"Confirmed Cases\"/\"Deaths\"/\"Recovered\"      Cases datasets by aligning the \"Country/Region\" column \n",
    "\n",
    "    After merging the “Confirmed Cases” data (which is consistent with “Deaths”, and “Recovered Cases” data in terms of number of rows i.e. same names under “Country/Region” column) with the testing data by applying outer join we can check that there are some countries which are only present in “Confirmed Cases” data and few are only present in        “Testing” data. Rather we see that there is 186 countries information in “Confirmed Cases”  data and only 86 countries information in “Testing” data. Moreover there are some countries which are present as different names in “Testing” data in comparison to \"Confirmed Cases” data and vice versa. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ‘Taiwan’ : ‘Taiwan*’ \n",
    "    - 'United States': 'US' \n",
    "    - ‘Czech Republic’ : ‘Czechia’\n",
    "    - ‘South Korea’: ‘Korea, South’\n",
    "    - ‘Myanmar’: ‘Burma’\n",
    "\n",
    "   After making the “Country/Region” name same in both the datasets we merge the “Testing” data with the “Country/Region” column of the “Confirmed Cases” data such that we have all the “Country/Region” values which are there in “Confirmed Cases” (or “Deaths or “Recovered Cases” data)\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, after this even our “Testing” data has 186 countries under “Country/Region” column <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Shifting all data to one starting point & converting the Dates format to Days <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "     Converting the Dates format to Days to bring all countries data to start from one starting point day \"1\" which would be the day on which the confirmed cases for the country reached 10 or more as done for “Confirmed Cases”, “Deaths”  and “Recovered Cases” data. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Unpivot the days columns to a column with name “Days” and value name “Testing Count” <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
